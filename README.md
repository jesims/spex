<!-- [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mpenet/spex.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mpenet/spex) -->

Small utility/extension library for `clojure.spec`.

Subject to changes/breakage. Use at own risk.

Start with

At the moment it does only two things

assuming

``` clojure
(require '[qbits.spex :as spex])
```

* adds a sugar to create namespaces within a ns
  If you are in the user namespace
  `(spex/rel-ns 'foo.bar)` would create user.foo.bar

* adds a metadata registry for registered specs, it currently supports
  variants of `vary-meta!`, `with-meta!`, `meta`, adds
  `unregister-meta!` and `with-doc`.

  you can then write code like:
  ```clj
  (-> (s/def ::foo string?)
      (spex/vary-meta! {:something :you-need}))

   ;; and retrieve the values with spex/meta
  (spex/meta ::foo) => {:something :you-need}
  ```
  But it would get tedious quickly when you alias specs and in cases where you might want to inherit from a "hierarchy" of specs
  Luckily spex maintains a hierarchy internally and you can leverage it easily:

  ```clj
  (s/def ::bar ::foo)

  (s/meta ::bar) => nil

  (spex/vary-meta! ::bar {:another :key})
  ;; just the meta of ::bar
  (s/meta ::bar) => {:another :key}

  :; merged meta of ::foo and ::bar
  (s/meta ::bar true) => {:something :you-need, :another :key}
  ```

  and `with-doc` is just sugar on top of all this to add docstrings to specs

  the internal hierarchy is queriable just like a normal clojure one
  you can use `spex/isa?` `spex/descendants` `spex/ancestors`
  `spex/parents` `spex/derive` `spex/underive`, which are just
  partially applied functions over the same functions in core with our
  own hierarchy `spex/spec-hierarchy`.


  ```clojure
     (s/def ::port (int-in-range? 1 65535))
     (s/def ::redis-port ::port)

     (spex/isa? ::redis-port ::port) => true

     (s/def ::cassandra-port ::port)

     ;; list all things ::port
     (spex/descendants ::port) => #{::redis-port ::cassandra-port}))

  ```

  This only works for aliases obviously.


  ```clj
  (with-doc ::foo "bla bla bla")
  ```

  All the functions that mutate the metadata of a spec return the spec
  key, that makes chaining easier:

  ```clojure
  (-> (s/def ::foo string?)
      (spex/vary-meta! {:something :you-need})
      (cond->
        something?
        (spex/vary-meta! {:something-else :you-might-need})))
  ```
