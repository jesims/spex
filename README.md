# spex
<!-- [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mpenet/spex.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mpenet/spex) -->

Small utility/extension library for `clojure.spec`.

Subject to changes/breakage. Use at own risk.

At the moment it does only two things:

* adds a sugar to create namespaces within a ns
  If you are in the user namespace
  `(spex/rel-ns 'foo.bar)` would create user.foo.bar

* adds a metadata registry for registered specs, it currently supports
  variants of `alter-meta!`, `reset-meta!`, `meta`, adds
  `unregister-meta!` and `with-doc`.

  you can then write code like:
  ```clj
  (-> (s/def ::foo string?)
      (spex/alter-meta! {:something :you-need}))

   ;; and retrieve the values with spex/meta
  (spex/meta ::foo) => {:something :you-need}
  ```
  But it would get tedious quickly when you alias specs and in cases where you might want to inherit from a "hierarchy" of specs
  If you `clojure.core/derive` one spec with another you can use the other arity of `spex/meta` and get an aggregate of values
  ```clj
  (s/def ::bar string?)

  (derive ::bar ::foo)

  (s/meta ::bar) => {:something :you-need}

  (spex/alter-meta! ::bar {:another :key})
  (s/meta ::bar) => {:something :you-need, :another :key}
  ```

  and `with-doc` is just sugar on top of all this to add docstrings to specs


  ```clj
  (with-doc ::foo "bla bla bla")
  ```
